##  Why EchoMind?

### The Problem
When beginners run commands like:
```bash
ps aux
```
They’re met with walls of confusing output filled with **columns**, **codes**, and **parameters**.  
Without context, learning feels frustrating — and many give up.

---

### The Solution

**EchoMind** bridges that gap by:

-  Interpreting terminal outputs intelligently  
-  Explaining their meaning in simple, beginner-friendly terms  
-  Helping users **learn while using** the terminal  

> Think of it as **“Google Translate for the command line.”**

## 💡 Example Usage

```bash
$ ps aux | echomind

 You’re looking at all the running processes.
- USER: who started the process
- %CPU / %MEM: how much system resources it uses
- COMMAND: what program or script is being executed
